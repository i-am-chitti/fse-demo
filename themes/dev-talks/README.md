## Get Involved in development :rocket:

### Method 1 (Recommended)
```
composer create-project rtcamp/dev-talks [folder_name]
```
This command is equivalant of cloning the repository and running `composer install && npm install`

### Method 2
Manually clone this repository using
```
git clone [URL to Git repo]
```
Having cloned this repository, install node packages and PHP dependencies using
```
composer install && npm install
```

In both the methods, you will be prompted with a theme setup wizard which will help you with the search-replace. That was all! You're good to go with building your block theme. :sparkles:
